## Overview

Waypoint Racing is an application used in waypoint sailing events.
The application is based on the [Traccar Client for Android](https://github.com/traccar/traccar-client-android).
The application doubles as a Tracking client used with the Traccar open source server software and
as a waypoint racing logger that shows the next racing waypoint or gate and logs the passing of those
gates to a custom logging server.
